# Inclusive Naming Initiative

The Inclusive Naming Initiative is a cross-organizational effort to remove harmful, racist and unclear language from our open source and closed source projects. We aim to come up with a set of industry standard replacement terms and surface companies and organizations leading efforts in this area.
